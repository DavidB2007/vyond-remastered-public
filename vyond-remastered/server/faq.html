<h2 id="about-vyond-remastered">About Vyond: Remastered</h2>


<h3 id="where-can-i-get-updates">Where can I get updates?</h3>
<p>You can join the Discord server here to get updates as they come out: <a href="https://discord.gg/2YQ4wUbTEN">https://discord.gg/2YQ4wUbTEN</a>
If you don’t want to use Discord, you could ask a friend who does to let you know when an update comes out, and they can send you the download link. Please do not email me asking for the latest version.</p>

<h3 id="will-it-work-forever-even-after-flash-is-retired">Will it work forever? Even after Flash is retired?</h3>
<p>It should, that’s the goal. Perhaps in the future when we all run 6000-bit machines implanted into our brains it won’t be compatible with that anymore, but I’m sure there’ll always be a way to run it. There is also futureproofing for Flash’s discontinuation, since Vyond: Remastered includes a Flash install and a version of ungoogled-chromium that supports Flash. By default, it starts from this, but you can change that in settings.bat. The included Chrome should not be used for browsing beyond using Flash content. You can also look into projects like <a href="http://lightspark.github.io/">Lightspark</a> and <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">ruffle</a> that are attempting to recreate Flash.</p>

<h3 id="so-i-could-just-unplug-my-internet-and-use-it">So I could just unplug my internet and use it?</h3>
<p>Pretty much, yes. Text-to-speech voices still require an internet connection, but there’s no way to take that offline, and the TTS companies unlikely to block you unless you spam them really quickly. You can also change, add, or even remove voices by modifying files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vyond-remastered/wrapper/tts</code>, should you wish to add a custom site or figure out a way to make them work offline too.</p>


<h3 id="wait-chromium-ive-heard-something-about-that-being-a-virus">Wait… Chromium? I’ve heard something about that being a virus…</h3>
<p>Chromium is literally Chrome. It’s the libre software base Google uses to build Chrome, and then they tack proprietary parts like auto-updates and Google integration in so it’s more appealing and they have more control over your experience. Ungoogled-chromium is just a version of Chromium that has any Google integration that’s left in Chromium removed for privacy.
If you don’t trust me, feel free to look through the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium</a>
And these VirusTotal results for it: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection</a>

<h3 id="can-i-import-my-videos-and-characters-from-another-wrapper-project-such-as-the-original-or-ga4sr">Can I import my videos and characters from another Wrapper project, such as the original or GA4SR?</h3>
<p>Yes! Take the _SAVED folder from your original, and drag it into the wrapper folder in Vyond: Remastered. If you’ve already saved anything in Vyond: Remastered, this’ll likely override it.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-import-character-ids-from-the-original-lvm">Can I import character IDs from the original LVM?</h3>
<p>Also yes! To do that, go to the matching character creator, and paste <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;original_asset_id=ID HERE</code> at the end of the URL.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-share-characters-made-in-vyond-remastered-with-others">Can I share characters made in Vyond Remastered with others?</h3>
<p>Also also yes! Look in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vyond-remastered\wrapper\_SAVED</code>, find the matching XML file, and then send that. To save an XML character, put them in your _SAVED folder, and make the number at the end one above the highest in the folder.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-start-without-the-launcher">How can I start without the launcher?</h3>
<p>This is meant for people who can’t run the start_vyond.bat file, such as Mac and GNU+Linux users.
On your first run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure Flash Player (<a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a>) and Node.js (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>) are installed</li>
  <li>The first time you run, open a command prompt/terminal and enter “npm install http-server -g”</li>
  <li>Look up how to install HTTPS certificates on your OS. Open the server folder and install the.crt.
    <ul>
      <li>If you can’t figure out how to install HTTPS certs, you can go to localhost:4664 and add a security exception, but this’ll need to be done on each browser you use Vyond: Remastered with.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Every time you want to start:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a terminal, go to the folder named “server”  and enter http-server -p 4343 -S -C the.crt -K the.key</li>
  <li>Now in a new terminal window, go to the folder named “wrapper” and enter npm start</li>
  <li>Open your preferred browser and enter localhost:4343 in the address bar.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="vyond-remastered-isnt-working">Vyond Remastered isn’t working!</h2>

<h3 id="the-launcher-is-crashing">The launcher is crashing!</h3>
<p>There’s likely not much way to solve this on your own. You should turn on VERBOSEWRAPPER in settings.bat, open a command prompt window, drag start_vyond.bat onto it, and run it. Then, when it crashes, take a screenshot and post it in our Discord server. If you’re tech savvy enough to understand whatever error pops up, feel free to elaborate.</p>

<h3 id="watermarks-arent-working">Watermarks aren’t working!</h3>
<p>This is likely tied to file uploading not working. You’re likely better off either placing them over your video as a prop, or using a video editor to place them on your video. My recommendations are Kdenlive and OpenShot, both of them are libre software you can use for free.</p>

<h3 id="some-tts-voices-wont-generate">Some TTS voices won’t generate!</h3>
<p>Some of them will never generate if your message is too long, as the current limit gives too much room and can go over what the voice services allow. If you’re generating a short message and some voices still don’t work, it may be possible that you’ve been rate-limited or a service has gone down. If all voices are not working, please check your internet connection.</p>

<h3 id="starters-arent-working">Starters aren’t working!</h3>
<p>I currently have no fix for this, you’ll just have to either copy them directly from projects or recreate them.</p>

<h3 id="resizing-set-in-the-character-creator-breaks-when-playing">Resizing set in the Character Creator breaks when playing!</h3>
<p>I currently have no fix for this, you’ll just have to size them manually in the editor. Head resizing should be working fine, it’s the size of the entire character that’s broken.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-Vyond-Remastered-on">Can I use Vyond: Remastered on…</h2>

<h3 id="macos-or-gnulinux">macOS or GNU+Linux?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can. See “How can I start without the launcher?” for instructions. However, this is likely to be much more tedious and annoying, and is currently untested. Linux support is currently planned and I fully intend on helping Linux users where possible, but Mac support is less likely and I have absolutely no experience with the operating system beyond similarities to Linux. Worth noting: if you’re running 32-bit Linux, you will not be able to install Node.js. An older version that supports 32-bit <em>may</em> work, but this is untested.</p>

<h3 id="chromeos">ChromeOS?</h3>
<p>ChromeOS is very heavily locked down, and supporting it would likely be troublesome to make, especially since Linux support would need to be made first. It might end up no longer working by the end of 2020 anyway, since Flash will be discontinued and there may not be a way to install it on ChromeOS past that point. Feel free to try it yourself though.</p>

<h3 id="ios-or-android">iOS or Android?</h3>
<p>No. Not unless you use some remote desktop trickery with a regular computer. This will never happen, Flash does not run on iOS at all, and the few Android versions out there are extremely old and barely work.</p>

<h3 id="windows-phone">Windows Phone?</h3>
<p>go back to 2013

<h2 id="legalese-things-i-guess">Legalese things I guess</h2>

<h3 id="can-i-copymodify-vyond-remastered">Can I copy/modify Vyond: Remastered?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I’m a huge libre software advocate, and if you want to change something or make your own version or whatever, please feel free! Just about everything in Offline is under the MIT license, except for the original GoAnimate code (obviously) and ungoogled-chromium (which is under the BSD 3-Clause license). If you do make changes, let me know and I’d be glad to look into putting them in official releases :)
‎</p>
<h3 id="why-was-the-original-wrapper-shut-down">Why was the original Wrapper shut down?</h3>
<p>The original Wrapper had the flaw of being hosted on a website. Without that website, it can’t function. And because Vyond didn’t want it to be there, they requested that it’s taken down. Despite what people say about CyanAnimate or whoever causing it, the developer of Wrapper, VisualPlugin, actually contacted Vyond directly asking if it was okay right after release. Offline has fixed this flaw, and the only way to get rid of it is to raid the homes of everyone who has a copy and burn their hard drive. In case it isn’t obvious, that won’t happen. The torrent download is meant to make it harder to take down as well.</p>
