Community Library Project (Comm_Lib v1.0, by mommadomma#8609)

Keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the community library that was recovered. so not everything has been archived from the community library. I'll probably add more as time goes on. Credit to those who contributed.

If there are any problems, dm me.

 ~~~ How to add to your wrapper. ~~~ 

1. Place this theme's folder into your asset reposity in /store/3a981f5cb2739137/ (if you host asset server someplace else)
If you use wrapper offline, just place it in /wrapper-ofline/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137/
2. Place the CommLib.xml file into the _THEMES folder
3. In themelist.xml, add [<theme id="CommLib" name="Community Library" cc_theme_id="CommLib"/>] to your xml file. (If you want headgear, Remove the cc_theme_id variable).
4. You should be good to go at this point, if there are any prolbems let me know
